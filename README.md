For this Coursework, I had to develop a website around a specific scenario and given specific design rules and page designs.
I also had to integrate a couple of JavaScript features into the finished website, which was done with the help of JQuery. One JavaScript feature of this website is a poll system which shows the results when the user clicks either yes or no and the other feature loading reviews from a given API link.

# Viewing the website

Viewing / Running the website does not require anything additonal, the HTML files can be opened from the file explorer or ran using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on Visual Studio Code.
