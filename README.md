# Scenario

This was apart of the second piece of Coursework I had to submit for my first year Web Development module. We had to develop a website around a specific scenario and given specific design rules and a page designs to develop a website.
We also had to integrate a couple of javascript features into the finished website, which was done with the help of JQuery. One feature being a poll system which shows the results when the user clicks either yes or no and the other feature loading reviews from a given API link (not included).
